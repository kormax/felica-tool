# Overview

This project implements tools for performing deep analysis of FeliCa card capabilities and the extraction of available data.

This application enables users to:
* Extract information about FeliCa cards, including:
  * Card identification (IDM, PMM);
  * System codes and services;
  * Block information and data;
  * Card capabilities.
* View detailed scan progress with step-by-step execution timings;
* View scan results, with information assembled from performed commands:
  * General information;
  * Command support report;
  * Per-system hierarchy overview:
    * Count of child nodes;
    * Key versions and types;
    * Auxiliary node properties;
    * Other node attributes;
    * Block data;
    * Related node annotation (names, etc).


# Requirements

* Android Studio;
* An Android device with NFC hardware and Android API level 31 or higher (Android 12);
* FeliCa targets to scan (transportation cards, mobile wallet passes, etc.).


# Usage

* Build and install the application to your device using Android Studio;
* Enable NFC on your Android device if not already enabled;
* Open the FeliCa Tool application;
* Place a FeliCa card near the device's NFC antenna;
* The application will automatically detect the card and begin the scanning process;
* Monitor the scan progress through the step-by-step interface;
* View detailed results by expanding individual steps or accessing the scan overview;
* Remove the card when scanning is complete.


# Project Structure

* `felica` - Core FeliCa protocol implementation containing:
  * Protocol models and entities;
  * Command classes validators & parsers;
  * Response classes validators & parsers;
  * Protocol constants and enumerations.
* `service` - Application business logic (scanning, analysis);
* `ui` - User interface components;
* `util` - Helper functions and extensions for data processing.


# Supported FeliCa Commands

At the current moment, "analysis" mode of the application attempts to detect support for the following commands:

**Note:** If you have tested this application with other FeliCa card types or targets and would like to contribute your results, we would gladly add them to this compatibility table. Please share your findings by opening an issue or submitting a pull request with the command support details for your specific card type.


# Testing

Most models used in the project have comprehensive data parsing tests.

Run tests using:
```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --info
```


# Building

Build and install the debug version:
```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```


# Improvements

* Improve annotation of known system, area codes, and IC types;
* Add an ability to export acquired information in JSON format:
  * Communication logs & timings;
  * Final results:
    * Format:
      * Hierarchical;
      * Flat;
    * Data:
      * Interpreted;
      * Raw.
* Improve/refactor the UI part of the project.
* Add testing for some more commands with unknown meanings:
  * UNKNOWN_GET_AREA_INFO (24);
  * UNKNOWN_PREISSUANCE_GET_STATUS (2E).
* Implement support for DES authentication commands (waiting for an ability to properly test it);
* Support external readers (PN532, PCSC);
* Add desktop (macOS, Linux, Windows) support by moving over to Compose Multiplatform;
* Add support for FALP commands (need hardware to test on);
* Add root-related functionality:
  * An ability to emulate a FeliCa standard card;
  * Support for commands with two-byte codes, some of which may only be available on wired interface, while talking to the embedded Osaifu-Keitai applet or chip.


# Known Issues

* Some tags may have partial block reading results due to an undiagnosed issue - waiting for test samples or user logs to help resolve this.


# Contributing

In case you've encountered an issue, or would like to help improving this project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

For command compatibility results, include details about your specific card type and which commands work or don't work. Feel free to comment out the unique part of the IDM (bytes 3-6, zero-indexed), or the block data, if that makes you more comfortable to do so.
